# US-Teen-Market-Segmentation-
Interacting with friends on a social networking service (SNS) has become a rite of passage for teenagers around the world. The many millions of teenage consumers using such sites have attracted the attention of marketers struggling to find an edge in an increasingly competitive market. One way to gain this edge is to identify segments of teenagers who share similar tastes, so that clients can avoid targeting advertisements to teens with no interest in the product being sold. For instance, sporting apparel is likely to be a difficult sell to teens with no interest in sports.
The dataset represents a random sample of 30,000 U.S. high school students who had profiles on a well-known SNS in 2006. To protect the usersâ€™ anonymity, the SNS will remain unnamed. The data was sampled evenly across four high school graduation years (2006 through 2009) representing the senior, junior, sophomore, and freshman classes at the time of data collection.
